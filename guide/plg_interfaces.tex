\chapter{Interface Extensions}
\label{ch:plugins:Interfaces}

Most users will soon be familiar with the usual user interface. A few
plugins are available which extend the regular user interface with a
few small additions which are presented first.  However, some
applications and installations of Stellarium require completely
different user interfaces. Mostly, these serve to avoid showing the
user interface panels to an audience, be that in your astronomy club
presentations, a domed planetarium or in a museum installation.


\section{Angle Measure Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:AngleMeasure}

\begin{quotation}\small
\noindent\emph{goes misty eyed}\\ 
I recall measuring the size of the Cassini Division when I was a student.
It was not the high academic glamor one might expect\ldots It was cloudy\ldots
It was rainy\ldots The observatory lab had some old scopes set up at one
end, pointing at a \emph{photograph} of Saturn at the other end of the
lab. We measured. We calculated. We wished we were in Hawaii. A picture
is worth a thousand words.
\end{quotation}

%\url{http://porpoisehead.net/images/plugin-angle-measure.jpg}

\noindent The Angle Measure plugin is a small tool which is used to measure the
angular distance between two points on the sky. 


%\subsection{Using the plugin}
%\label{sec:plugins:AngleMeasure:using}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enable the tool by clicking the tool-bar button, or by pressing
  \key{\ctrl+A}. A message will appear at the bottom of the screen to
  tell you that the tool is active.
\item Drag a line from the first point to the second point using the
  left mouse button
\item To clear the measurement, click the right mouse button
\item To deactivate the angle measure tool, press the tool-bar button
  again, or press \key{\ctrl+A} on the keyboard.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In the configuration dialog, you can configure if you want to have
distances given on the rotating sphere, or in horizontal
(alt-azimuthal) coordinates. You can also link one point to the
resting horizon, the other to the sky and observe how angles change.

\section{Compass Marks Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:CompassMarks}

%\url{http://porpoisehead.net/images/plugin-compass-marks.jpg}

Stellarium helps the user get their bearings using the cardinal point
feature -- the North, South, East and West markers on the horizon.
Compass Marks takes this idea and extends it to add markings every few
degrees along the horizon, and includes compass bearing values in
degrees.

When activated (see section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), there
is a tool bar button \guibutton{0.6}{bt_compass_off} for toggling the
compass markings.  Note that when you enable compass marks, the
cardinal points will be turned off.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{compass-marks-plugin}
\caption{Markings of Compass Marks Plugin}
\label{fig:plugins:CompassMarks}
\end{figure}

%% TODO/FIXME?: The following is not true for current pre-0.15:
%You can have both active at once, but there is a small
%bug which means you have to press \key{Q} \emph{two times} to
%re-enable cardinal points after enabling the compass markings.

\section{Equation of Time Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:EquationOfTime}

%% The figure just reproduces most of the text. I (GZ) regard it not so necessary. 
%\begin{figure}[h]
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{EquationOfTime-plugin.jpg}
%\caption{Interface of Equation of Time plugin}
%\label{fig:EqOfTime}
%\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]\centering
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{GZ_analemma_p1000}
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{GZ_analemma_p2000}
\caption{Figure-8 plots for Equation of Time, for years 1000 (left)
  and 2000 (right). These plots, often found on sundials, link solar
  declination (vertical axis) and its deviation at mean noon from the
  meridian, in minutes. Labeled dots indicate when the sun entered the
  respective Zodiacal sign (30\degree section of the
  ecliptic). Figures by Georg Zotti.}
\label{fig:EqOfTime}
\end{figure}


\noindent The Equation of Time plugin shows the solution of the equation of time. % (Fig.~\ref{fig:EqOfTime}).
This describes the discrepancy between two kinds of
solar time:
\begin{description}
\item[Apparent solar time] directly tracks the motion of the sun. Most sundials show this time.
\item[Mean solar time] tracks a fictitious ``mean'' sun with noons 24 hours apart. 
\end{description}

There is no universally accepted definition of the sign of the
equation of time. Some publications show it as positive when a sundial
is ahead of a clock; others when the clock is ahead of the sundial. In
the English-speaking world, the former usage is the more common, but
is not always followed. Anyone who makes use of a published table or
graph should first check its sign usage.

If enabled (see section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}), click on
the Equation of Time button \guibutton{0.6}{bt_EquationOfTime_72dpi}
on the bottom toolbar to display the value for the equation of time on
top of the screen.


\subsection{Section \big[EquationOfTime\big] in config.ini file}
\label{sec:plugins:EquationOfTime:config}

You can edit \file{config.ini} file by yourself for changes of the
settings for the Equation of Time plugin -- just make it carefully!

\includegraphics[trim=0 55 0 0,clip,width=.52\textwidth]{FOV-plugin.jpg}
\caption{Configuration dialog of Field of View plugin}
\label{fig:plugins:FieldOfView}
\end{figure}

\noindent By default Stellarium uses smooth zooming via mouse wheel or
keyboard shortcuts. Some users may want stepwise zooming to fixed
values for field of view like in the \program{Cartes du
  Ciel}\footnote{SkyChart / Cartes du Ciel planetarium:
  \url{http://www.ap-i.net/skychart/en/start}} planetarium program,
and this plugin provides this feature. You can edit values and use the
keyboard for quick-setting of FOV. All values in degrees.

%\section{Using the Field of View plugin}

\section{Text User Interface}
\label{sec:plugins:TextUserInterface}

%\url{http://porpoisehead.net/images/plugin-tui.jpg}

This plugin re-implements the ``TUI'' of the pre-0.10 versions of
Stellarium, an unobtrusive menu used primarily by planetarium system
operators to change settings, run scripts and so on.

Given that color configuration for lines and texts cannot be found
elsewhere, an interesting part for general use (at least for extended
configuration sessions) is the way to interactively select colors in
this menu.

A full list of the commands for the TUI plugin is
given in section~\ref{sec:plugins:TUI:commands}. 

\subsection{Using the Text User Interface}
\label{sec:plugins:TUI:using}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Activate the text menu using the \key{\Alt+T} key.\footnote{This
    used to be hard-coded to \key{M} before version 0.15, but
    \key{\Alt+T} is better to remember as it runs parallel with
    \key{\ctrl+T} for switching the GUI panels, and frees up \key{M}
    for the Milky Way. The \key{\Alt+T} keybinding is hardcoded, i.e.,
    cannot be reconfigured by the user, and should not be used for
    another function.}
\item
  Navigate the menu using the cursors keys.
\item
  To edit a value, press the right cursor until the value you wish to
  change it highlighted with \textgreater{} and \textless{} marks, e.g.\
  \textgreater{}3.142\textless{}. Then press the cursor keys \keys{\arrowkeyup} and \keys{\arrowkeydown} to
  change the value. You may also type in a new value with the other keys
  on the keyboard.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Remote Control}
\label{sec:plugin:RemoteControl}

The Remote Control plugin was developed in 2015 during the 
\href{http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis/}{ESA Summer of Code in Space} 
initiative. It enables the user to control Stellarium through an external web 
interface using a standard web browser like Firefox or Chrome, instead of using 
the main GUI. This works on the same computer Stellarium runs as well as over 
the network. Even more, multiple "remote controls" can access the same 
Stellarium instance at the same time, without getting in the way of each other. 
Much of the functionality the main interface provides is already available 
through it, and it is still getting extended.

The plugin may be useful for presentation scenarios, hiding the GUI from the 
audience and allowing the presenter to change settings on a separate monitor 
without showing distracting dialog windows. It also allows to start and stop 
scripts remotely. Because the web interface can be customized (or completely 
replaced) with some knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, another possibility 
is a kiosk mode, where untrusted users can execute a variety of predefined 
actions (like starting recorded tours) without having access to all Stellarium 
settings. The web API can also be accessed directly (without using a browser 
and the HTML interface), allowing control of Stellarium with external programs 
and scripts using HTTP calls like with the tools \file{wget} and \file{curl}.

\subsection{Using the plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:RemoteControl:using}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{remote_web}
\caption{The default remote control web interface}
\label{fig:plugins:RemoteControl:using}
\end{figure}

After enabling the plugin, you can set it up through the configuration dialog. 
When ``Enable automatically on startup'' is checked (it is by default), the web 
server is automatically started whenever Stellarium starts. You can also 
manually start/stop the server using the ``Server enabled'' checkbox and the 
button \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{remote} in the toolbar.

The plugin starts a HTTP server on the specified port. The default port is 
8090, so you can try to reach the remote control after enabling it by starting 
a browser on the same computer and entering \url{http://localhost:8090} in the 
address bar. When trying to access the remote control from another computer, 
you need the IP address or the hostname of the server on which Stellarium runs. 
The plugin shows the locally detected address, but depending on your network or 
if you need external access you might need to use a different one 
--- contact your network administrator if you need help with that.

The access to the remote control may optionally be restricted with a simple 
password.

\textbf{Warning:} \emph{currently no network encryption is used, meaning that 
an attacker having access to your network can easily find out the password by 
waiting for a user entering it. Access from the Internet to the 
plugin should generally be restricted, except if countermeasures such as VPN 
usage are taken! If you are in a home network using NAT (network access 
translation), this should be enough for basic security except if port 
forwarding or a DMZ is configured.}

\subsection{Remote Control Web Interface}
\label{sec:plugins:RemoteControl:webinterface}


If you are familiar with the main Stellarium interface, you should easily find 
your way around the web interface. Tabs at the top allow access to 
different settings and controls. The remote control automatically uses the 
same language as set in the main program.

The contents of the various tabs:
\begin{description}
\item[Main] Contains the time controls and most of the buttons of the 
main bottom toolbar. An additional control allows moving the view like when 
dragging the mouse or using the arrow keys in Stellarium, and a slider enables 
the changing of the field of view. There are also buttons to quickly execute 
time jumps using the commonly used astronomical time intervals.
\item[Selection] Allows searching and selecting objects like in \autoref{sec:gui:search}. 
SIMBAD search is also supported. Quick select buttons are available for the 
primary solar system objects. It also displays the information text for current 
selection.
\item[Sky] Settings related to the sky display as shown in the ``View'' dialog 
as shown in \autoref{sec:gui:view:sky}.
\item[DSO] The deep-sky object catalog, filter and display settings like in 
\autoref{sec:gui:view:markings}.
\item[Landscape] Changing and configuring the background landscape, see 
\autoref{sec:gui:view:landscape}
\item[Actions and scripts] Lists all registered actions, and allows starting 
and stopping of scripts (\autoref{ch:scripting}). If there is no button for the 
action you want in another tab, you can find all actions which can be 
configured as a keyboard shortcut (\autoref{sec:gui:configuration}) here.
\item[Location] Allows changing the location, like in 
\autoref{sec:gui:location}. Custom location saving is currently not 
supported.
\item[Projection] Switch the projection method used, like \autoref{sec:gui:view:markings}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Remote Control Commandline API}
\label{sec:plugins:RemoteControl:CLI}

It is also possible to send commands via command line, e.g.,

\begin{commands}[\scriptsize]
wget -q --post-data 'id=show.ssc' http://stella:8090/api/scripts/run >/dev/null 2>&1
curl --data 'id=myScript.ssc' http://localhost:8090/api/scripts/run >/dev/null 2>&1
curl -d     'id=myScript.ssc' http://localhost:8090/api/scripts/run >/dev/null 2>&1
\end{commands}
This allows triggering automatic show setups for museums etc.\ via  some centralized schedulers like \command{cron}.

% TODO: Please list all available commands with examples here!
  
\subsection{Developer information}
\label{sec:plugins:RemoteControl:developer}

If you are a developer and would like to add functionality to the Remote 
Control API, customize the web interface or access the API through another 
program, further information can be found in the 
\href{http://stellarium.org/doc-plugins/head/}{plugin's developer 
documentation}.

\section{Solar System Editor Plugin}
\label{sec:plugins:SolarSystemEditor}

Stellarium stores its data (orbital elements and other details) about
solar system objects (planets, their moons, minor bodies) in the file
\file{data/ssystem.ini}. The file will be taken from the user data
directory if it also exists there, which means, users can add minor
planets or comets as they become observable by editing this file.


This plugin provides a window to the Minor Planet Center (MPC) where the
latest Solar System information can be found. When this plugin is
loaded (see section~\ref{sec:Plugins:EnablingPlugins}) the first tab
allows to import, export or reset your \file{ssystem.ini}.

The second tab lists all currently loaded objects.  It is recommended
to remove old entries of last year's comets if you don't need them any
longer.
If you have a very weak computer, you may want to reduce the number of
minor bodies (and maybe even planetary moons) to improve performance.

On this tab, you find the option to connect to the MPC and download current orbital elements. 

%% TODO: Obviously, we should adapt our TZ handling to make this
